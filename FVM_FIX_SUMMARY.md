# FVM Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem Statement

FVM (Flutter Version Management) was not found in the environment because it was only installed and configured for the user running the Python setup, not for both the `komodo` user and `root` user as required by the system architecture.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Limited User Scope**: FVM installation only occurred during Python setup phase, affecting only the current user
2. **Missing System Integration**: Install script didn't include FVM installation step
3. **Inadequate PATH Configuration**: Shell profiles were only updated for single user
4. **Poor Detection Logic**: FVM detection only checked system PATH, not common installation locations

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Install Script Enhancements (`install.sh`)

**Added FVM Installation Function**:
- `install_fvm_for_user()`: Installs FVM for specified user with multiple fallback methods
- `install_fvm()`: Orchestrates FVM installation for current user, komodo user, and root user
- Added to installation pipeline between `install_uv` and `setup_git`

**Enhanced Shell Environment Setup**:
- Updated `setup_env.sh` template to include FVM paths
- Added `.pub-cache/bin` and `.fvm/default/bin` to PATH automatically
- Ensures FVM availability on shell startup

**Installation Methods**:
1. Use existing Dart/Flutter if available
2. Bootstrap Flutter installation for FVM setup
3. Graceful fallback with warning if installation fails

### 2. Python Code Improvements

**Enhanced FVM Detection (`src/komodo_codex_env/flutter_manager.py`)**:
- Improved `is_fvm_installed()` with multi-location checking
- Added common path detection for all users:
  - `$HOME/.pub-cache/bin/fvm`
  - `/root/.pub-cache/bin/fvm`
  - `/home/komodo/.pub-cache/bin/fvm`
- Dynamic PATH updates for current session

**Multi-User PATH Management (`src/komodo_codex_env/dependency_manager.py`)**:
- New `add_to_path_for_multiple_users()` method
- Safely updates shell profiles for:
  - Current user
  - Komodo user (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.profile`)
  - Root user (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.profile`)
- Comprehensive error handling and status reporting

**Updated Setup Process (`src/komodo_codex_env/setup.py`)**:
- Modified environment setup to use multi-user PATH configuration
- Ensures FVM paths available system-wide

### 3. Verification and Debugging Tools

**FVM Verification Script (`scripts/verify_fvm.py`)**:
- Comprehensive FVM installation checker
- Per-user verification for current, komodo, and root users
- Checks:
  - User existence
  - FVM command availability
  - Binary file locations
  - PATH configuration in shell profiles
  - FVM functionality testing
  - Flutter version listings

### 4. Documentation

**Created comprehensive documentation (`docs/FVM_CONFIGURATION.md`)**:
- Problem description and solution overview
- Technical implementation details
- Usage instructions and troubleshooting guide
- Multi-user configuration benefits

## Key Features

### Multi-User Support
- FVM installed and configured for komodo user, root user, and current user
- Consistent Flutter version management across all user accounts
- Proper file permissions and ownership handling

### Robust Detection
- Multiple fallback mechanisms for FVM detection
- Common installation path checking
- Session PATH updates when FVM found in non-standard locations

### Comprehensive PATH Management
- System-wide PATH configuration during installation
- Multi-shell support (bash, zsh, generic profile)
- Safe profile updates with existence checking

### Verification Tools
- Built-in verification script for troubleshooting
- Status reporting through main CLI interface
- Detailed error messages and resolution guidance

## Installation Flow

1. **Install Script Phase**:
   - Creates komodo user if needed
   - Installs system dependencies
   - Sets up Python environment
   - **NEW**: Installs FVM for all users
   - Configures Git
   - Sets up project
   - Configures shell integration with FVM paths

2. **Python Setup Phase**:
   - Verifies FVM installation
   - Enhances PATH configuration
   - Sets up Flutter via FVM
   - Configures development environment

3. **Verification Phase**:
   - Built-in checks during setup
   - Optional manual verification script
   - Status reporting via CLI commands

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reliable FVM Access**: FVM available regardless of which user runs commands
2. **Consistent Environment**: Same Flutter version management across all users
3. **Automatic Configuration**: No manual PATH setup required
4. **Robust Fallbacks**: Multiple detection and installation methods
5. **Easy Troubleshooting**: Verification tools and clear error messages
6. **Future-Proof**: Works with different shell configurations and user setups

## Testing and Validation

- Bash syntax validation: `bash -n install.sh`
- Python syntax compilation: All modules compile successfully
- FVM verification script: Comprehensive multi-user testing
- Integration testing: Full installation pipeline works correctly

## Files Modified

### Install Script
- `install.sh`: Added FVM installation functions and pipeline integration

### Python Modules
- `src/komodo_codex_env/flutter_manager.py`: Enhanced FVM detection and PATH management
- `src/komodo_codex_env/dependency_manager.py`: Added multi-user PATH configuration
- `src/komodo_codex_env/setup.py`: Updated to use multi-user PATH management

### New Files
- `scripts/verify_fvm.py`: FVM verification and debugging tool
- `docs/FVM_CONFIGURATION.md`: Comprehensive documentation
- `FVM_FIX_SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## Usage Commands

```bash
# Installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/takenagain/komodo-codex-env/main/install.sh | bash

# With root support
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/takenagain/komodo-codex-env/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --allow-root

# Verification
python3 ~/.komodo-codex-env/scripts/verify_fvm.py

# FVM management
kce-fvm-list
kce-fvm-install 3.32.0
kce-fvm-use 3.32.0
fvm flutter --version
```

This fix ensures FVM is reliably available for both komodo user and root user environments, resolving the original issue where FVM was not found in the environment.
