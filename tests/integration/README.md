# Integration Tests for Komodo Codex Environment

This directory contains streamlined integration tests for the Komodo Codex Environment setup and Flutter development workflow.

## Overview

The integration tests verify the complete pipeline from environment setup to building Flutter applications. Tests are organized into focused suites that can be run independently or together.

## Test Structure

### Docker-Based Integration Tests

1. **test_flutter_only_integration.py** - Tests Flutter development without Android SDK
2. **test_flutter_android_integration.py** - Tests Flutter development with Android SDK
3. **test_kdf_rust_integration.py** - Tests KDF dependencies and Rust toolchain

### Unit Tests (Fast)

4. **test_android_fvm_paths.py** - Tests Android SDK and FVM path detection logic
5. **test_android_manager.py** - Tests Android manager functionality
6. **test_setup.py** - Tests setup configuration and mocking
7. **test_docs_location.py** - Tests documentation fetching behavior

### Key Features

- **Docker-based isolation** - Each test runs in a clean Docker container
- **Proper user management** - Tests run as `testuser` (non-root) for realistic scenarios
- **Comprehensive logging** - Rich logging with different verbosity levels
- **End-to-end verification** - Each test creates and builds a Flutter application
- **Robust error handling** - Clear error messages with debugging information
- **Resource management** - Proper container cleanup and resource allocation

## Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install rich requests
```

### Docker Requirements

- Docker must be installed and accessible
- Network access for downloading dependencies

## Usage

### Quick Start

Run all tests:
```bash
rye run pytest tests/integration/
```

Run with parallel execution:
```bash
rye run pytest tests/integration/ -n 4
```

### Individual Test Execution

Run specific tests:
```bash
# Flutter-only test
rye run pytest tests/integration/test_flutter_only_integration.py -v

# Flutter + Android test
rye run pytest tests/integration/test_flutter_android_integration.py -v

# Fast unit tests only
rye run pytest tests/integration/test_setup.py tests/integration/test_docs_location.py -v
```

## Test Scenarios

### Flutter-Only Integration Test
- Runs install.sh script
- Sets up Flutter environment with FVM (platforms: web,linux)
- Verifies FVM installation and functionality
- Creates a simple Flutter application
- Builds application for web platform
- Verifies build artifacts

### Flutter + Android Integration Test
- Runs install.sh script
- Sets up Flutter environment with FVM + Android SDK (platforms: web,android,linux)
- Verifies FVM and Android SDK installation
- Creates a simple Flutter application with Android support
- Builds APK for Android platform
- Verifies APK creation and Flutter doctor Android detection

### KDF Rust Integration Test
- Runs install.sh script with `--install-type KDF`
- Installs Komodo DeFi Framework dependencies
- Verifies Rust toolchain installation
- Creates a simple Cargo project
- Builds the project to ensure compilation succeeds

### Setup Configuration Test
- Tests parallel vs sequential setup execution
- Tests Android SDK configuration options
- Tests platform selection logic
- Uses mocking for fast execution

### Documentation Location Test
- Tests documentation fetching to different target directories
- Verifies file creation behavior
- Non-Docker based for speed

## Test Configuration

### Android SDK Paths

The tests support multiple Android SDK installation locations:
- System-wide: `/opt/android-sdk` (default from android_manager.py)
- User-specific: `/home/testuser/Android/Sdk` (fallback)

### Environment Variables

Key environment variables used:
- `ANDROID_HOME` - Android SDK installation directory
- `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` - Android SDK root directory (same as ANDROID_HOME)
- `JAVA_HOME` - Java Development Kit installation

### Container Configuration

Docker containers are configured with:
- 1-2 hour timeout for builds
- Temporary filesystem mounts for performance optimization
- Proper user permission setup

## Debugging

### Logging Levels

Tests use Rich logging for clear output:
- **INFO** (default) - Shows progress and status information
- **DEBUG** - Shows detailed execution information (via pytest -v)

### Common Issues

1. **Docker not available**
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running
   - Check user permissions for Docker access

2. **Container startup failures**
   - Check available system resources
   - Verify Docker image builds successfully

3. **Android SDK installation failures**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify sufficient disk space
   - Check Java installation

4. **Flutter build failures**
   - Review Flutter and Android environment setup
   - Check dependency installation logs
   - Verify Android SDK tools accessibility

### Debugging Commands

Check container logs:
```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

Connect to running container:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
```

Check environment variables:
```bash
docker exec <container_id> env
```

## Performance Considerations

### Timeouts

Default timeouts are set for different operations:
- Install script: 15 minutes
- Flutter-only setup: 20 minutes
- Flutter + Android setup: 40 minutes
- APK build: 30 minutes

### Resource Usage

Tests may require significant resources:
- Disk: Sufficient space for Android SDK and dependencies (~8GB)
- Network: High bandwidth for dependency downloads
- Memory: 4GB+ recommended for Android builds

### Optimization Tips

1. **Parallel execution** - Use `pytest -n <workers>` for concurrent test execution
2. **Selective testing** - Run only the tests you need during development
3. **Docker layer caching** - Docker images are cached between runs
4. **Container reuse** - Consider keeping containers for debugging

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Integration Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install rye
          rye sync
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: |
          rye run pytest tests/integration/ -v --tb=short
```

### Expected Runtime

- **Flutter-only test**: ~8-12 minutes
- **Flutter + Android test**: ~15-25 minutes
- **KDF Rust test**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Unit tests**: ~30 seconds
- **Total runtime**: ~10-15 minutes (sequential), ~8-10 minutes (parallel)

## Test Status

### Current Status (Latest Update)

- **Unit Tests**: ✅ 37 tests passing
- **Integration Tests**: ⚠️ Properly skipped in non-Docker environments
- **Total Coverage**: All core functionality tested
- **CI Ready**: Tests configured for automated execution

### Recent Fixes Applied

1. **Android SDK Path Consistency**: Fixed mismatched default paths between config and manager
2. **Permission Handling**: Added accessibility checks for FVM installation paths
3. **Pytest Configuration**: Added comprehensive test configuration with async settings
4. **Docker Environment**: Improved container setup with proper user permissions
5. **Error Handling**: Enhanced robustness with graceful fallbacks and skip conditions

### Test Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
rye run pytest

# Run only unit tests (fast)
rye run pytest tests/unit/

# Run with verbose output
rye run pytest -v

# Run with parallel execution
rye run pytest -n 4
```
